## Replicon Clock In Bug Fix Extension

### About

    Replicon does not check if you are already clocked-in when you click the
"Clock In" button.  This can cause your clock-in time to be later than it
should be, and you will be paid less than you've earned.

    This extension inserts a script into the page that disables the "Clock In"
button after you've clicked it the first time.
