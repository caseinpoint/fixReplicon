## Replicon Clock-In Bug Fix Firefox Extension

### About

Replicon does not check if you are already clocked-in when you click the
"Clock In" button.  This can cause your clock-in time to be later than it
should be, and you will be paid for less time than you've worked.

This Firefox extension inserts a script into the page that disables the "Clock
In" button after you've clicked it the first time.  The button is re-enabled by
reloading the page.
